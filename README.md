# Folkatech - ReactJS Test

- React js version 18

- Css Framework using Chakra ui, Frammer motion and also React-icon for icons to make it easier in responsive mode.

- in integration with FE I use custom hooks on react which I named useLogin

- for temporary storage I use localstorage can also use state management but to shorten the time I use localstorage

# Note

- Here there are indeed some designs that are not appropriate because they are more focused on functional integration with BE

- because the time given is quite short so there are some ui that are not suitable but I have adjusted the data from BE that must be displayed. 

- as well as in the product list I have tried to integrate but because of the unstable api connection, it is often disconnected and does not get a response from the API.

- here I use localstorage as data management to shorten the time
